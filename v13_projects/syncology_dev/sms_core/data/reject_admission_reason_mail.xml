                            We regret to inform you that ${object.admission_id.full_name} cannot join us for the following reasons:<br/>
                            ${object.adm_reject_reason} <br/> We are sure that many schools out there will be lucky to have
                            ${object.admission_id.full_name}, yet It was an honor that you chose us first. Thank you and we wish you and
                            ${object.admission_id.full_name} all the best.
